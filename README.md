# deep-learning-gene-expression
Deep learning methods for feature selection in gene expression autism data.
# Description
This project implements several features selection algorithms intended for finding the most significant subset of genes and gene sequences stored in dataset of gene expression microarray. 

Current version of project provides the following list of feature selection algorithms:
* Fisher discriminant analysis
* two sample t-test
* feature correlation wita a class
  
More implementation details of the above methods can be found here:
